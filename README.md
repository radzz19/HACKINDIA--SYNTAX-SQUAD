TokenForge is a decentralized platform that allows users to buy and sell NFTs representing computing resources such as CPU, GPU, and storage devices. By leveraging blockchain technology, TokenForge creates a transparent and secure marketplace where users can trade computing power as easily as digital assets, all without the need for intermediaries.

Features :

1. Decentralized Marketplace: TokenForge enables peer-to-peer trading of NFTs representing computing resources, ensuring transparency and eliminating the need for intermediaries like banks or brokers.
   
2. NFTs for Computing Resources: Each token represents a real-world computing resource, such as CPU, GPU, or storage space, allowing users to buy, sell, or trade these assets as NFTs.
   
3. Blockchain-Powered: Built on blockchain technology, TokenForge ensures a tamper-proof, transparent ledger of all transactions.
   
4. Smart Contracts: Resource exchanges are automated through smart contracts, ensuring security, trust, and efficiency without the need for third-party oversight.
   
5. Real-Time Pricing: The platform provides live prices for NFTs, enabling users to make informed decisions based on market demand.
   
6. User Wallets: Secure wallets allow users to store, manage, and track their tokens and transaction history.
   

How It Works

1. Buy & Sell NFTs: Users can mint NFTs representing computing resources like CPU, GPU or other  storage devices. These NFTs can be bought and sold on the 
   marketplace.
   
2. Blockchain Security: All transactions are recorded on a decentralized, immutable blockchain ledger ensuring transparency and trust in the trading process.
   
3. Smart Contracts: Smart contracts automatically execute trades and transfers between users without needing intermediaries, reducing costs and delays.
